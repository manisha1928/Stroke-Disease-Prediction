Stroke is a significant medical condition that occurs when the blood supply to a part of the brain is interrupted or reduced, preventing brain tissue from getting oxygen and nutrients. This can lead to severe health complications, long-term disability, or even death. Early stroke risk detection and prediction can significantly improve patient outcomes by enabling timely intervention and treatment.

Objective:- 
This project aims to develop a machine learning-based system that predicts the risk of stroke in individuals based on various health and lifestyle parameters. This system aims to assist healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk patients and providing preventive care to reduce the incidence of strokes.

Methodology:-

-> Data Collection:
 - Health records from hospitals and medical institutions.
 - Publicly available datasets such as the Framingham Heart Study.
 - Data from health surveys and patient questionnaires.
   
-> Data Analysis:
 - Preprocessing: Cleaning and normalizing the data, handling missing values.
 - Feature Selection: Identifying key features that influence stroke risk.
- Model Selection: Testing machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Networks.
  
-> System Design:
 - Architecture: A modular design comprising data input, processing, and output components.
 - Implementation: Using Python, libraries like scikit-learn and TensorFlow, and frameworks such as Flask or Django for the web application.

Conclusion:-
The Stroke Disease Prediction project using machine learning aims to provide an effective tool for predicting stroke risk, aiding in early detection and preventive care. By leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms, this system seeks to enhance the capabilities of healthcare professionals and improve patient outcomes. The successful implementation of this project will lead to better management of stroke risk, reduction in stroke-related morbidity and mortality, and overall improvements in public health.
